                        React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
                        and
                        the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
                        platform‚Äôs
                        APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span
                            class="italic-text"> bundles
                            of reusable, nestable code </span>. You can learn more about React in the next section. But
                        first, let‚Äôs
                        cover how components work in React Native.

                        React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular open source library for
                        building user interfaces with
                        JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
                        can
                        get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-part spase-part">
                        We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-part spase-part">
                        <span class="bold-text">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in
                        its examples: friendly,
                        approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-part spase-part">
                        <span class="bold-text">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
                        write elements inside JavaScript like
                        so: <span class="bacground-text"> &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-part spase-part">
                        The React docs have <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to
                        learn even more. Because JSX is
                        JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span
                            class="bacground-text">name</span> for the cat, name, and
                        embedding it with curly braces inside<span class="bacground-text"> &lt;Text&gt;</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-part spase-part">
                        <span class="bold-text">+ props</span>. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-part spase-part">
                        <span class="bold-text">+ state</span>. While you can think of props as arguments you use to
                        configure how components render, state
                        is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over
                        time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

                    <p class="text-part spase-part">
                        TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                            class="italic-text">onChangeText</span> prop that
                        takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
                        takes a
                        function to be called when the text is submitted.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-part spase-part">
                        For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                        language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence
                        "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
